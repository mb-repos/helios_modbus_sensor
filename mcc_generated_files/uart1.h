/**
  @Summary
    Read a byte of data from the UART1.

  @Description
    This routine reads a byte of data from the UART1.

  @Preconditions
    UART1_Initialize() function should have been called
    before calling this function. The transfer status should be checked to see
    if the receiver is not empty before calling this function.

	UART1_DataReady is a macro which checks if any byte is received.
	Call this macro before using this function.

  @Param
    None

  @Returns
    A data byte received by the driver.
	
  @Example
	<code>
            void main(void) {
                            // initialize the device
                            SYSTEM_Initialize();
